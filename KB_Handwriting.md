<h1>What is handwriting?</h1>

Handwriting is basically just the ability to scribble, or paint or draw as such which could be sent to contacts, with the ability to draw small drawings as such. It was implemented officially in Windows Messenger 7.0 (older versions required a plug-in). A mouse was all it needs to start drawing with the handwriting feature.<br>

<h3>Packet Research</h3>

Research is underway for handwriting and currently is not complete, but otherwise here is some research for handwriting. I have decided to do a straight line for this example, for the reason that longer packets tend to have the base64 strings truncated.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Alexander Pang Wu for attempts for handwriting tests with WireShark:<br>

The package seems large overall, since the handwriting section is also being encoded to base64. This can be translated basically as:<br>
<br>
<pre><code>MSG eagleearth@live.com Eagle%20Earth%200.21 688\r\n<br>
MIME-Version: 1.0\r\n<br>
Content-Type: application/x-ms-ink\r\n<br>
\r\n<br>
base64:AGIcA4CABB0D0AQOAwRIEUVkGRQyCACAHgIAAHBCMwgA4BICAABIQhWrqtNBq6rTQQAAAD4AgOq+HgMBBnwKJBqGyNkeAQUDFQNdQwFRN1EhguDhI+DhYGBIAIL8UfikDNEoAA==<br>
</code></pre>

This can be distinguished by the difference between handwriting and plain text messages with the section "Content-Type". Text messages are usually shown like this (plain) with its content type:<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Content Type: Plain Text</i>
<pre><code>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\r\n<br>
</code></pre>
<br />
<i>Content Type: Handwriting Message</i>
<pre><code>Content-Type: application/x-ms-ink\r\n<br>
</code></pre>



<h3>Decoding the Message</h3>

The main part of this packet is that bit with "base64:" followed by its code shown below ( this message has been encoded with base64):<br>
<br>
<pre><code>base64:AGIcA4CABB0D0AQOAwRIEUVkGRQyCACAHgIAAHBCMwgA4BICAABIQhWrqtNBq6rTQQAAAD4AgOq+HgMBBnwKJBqGyNkeAQUDFQNdQwFRN1EhguDhI+DhYGBIAIL8UfikDNEoAA==<br>
</code></pre>


Currently this can be decoded basically with just a simple software of some website that can do so, or it can be done through coding in C# in a conversion like this (where "Text Goes Here" can be replaced with the base64 string, and that as long as some procedure can take that function, such as saving a binary as that converted text):<br>
<br>
<pre><code>Convert.FromBase64String("Text Goes Here")<br>
</code></pre>


I have left a source to show a sample of this just in case, which can also be found at the bottom of the references section, which demonstrates a example of a base64 message being able to be saved as a decoded base64 String. However in this case, another application is used instead to decode this base64 encoded text.<br>
<br>
<br>
Eventually it will turn out like this  with the current example (this may not view correctly due to its characters):<br>
<br>
<pre><code> b‚Ç¨‚Ç¨√êHEd2 ‚Ç¨  pB3 √†  HB¬´¬™√ìA¬´¬™√ìA   &gt; ‚Ç¨√™¬æ|<br>
$‚Ä†√à√ô]CQ7Q!‚Äö√†√°#√†√°``H ‚Äö√ºQ√∏¬§√ë( <br>
</code></pre>


The file of this decoded message can be obtained at the bottom of the references, where it has a much better binary version of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Loading the Message</h3>

The way how MSN handwriting is interpreted is that the message is decoded to binary (which we have done in the last step), and then loading it as a ISF file (which stands for "Ink Serialized Format"). These files are basically just ink files which are used in Microsoft Tablets as such.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have used the source "Mod_InktoBitmap_07" project (can be found one of the links below) and compiled it, and I was able to successfully get the ISF viewable. Here is the image converted to a PNG image file:<br>
<br>
<br>

This is the result with the steps done, it is also possible to go through this with another larger image (with WireShark, but be careful with larger handwriting data as it becomes truncated).<br>
<br>
<br />

<h2>Questions</h2>


<b>Q:</b><br />How will these ISF Format Converter Classes be implemented into MSNP-Sharp?<br />
<br /><b>A:</b><br />There are a couple of choices. Either that the classes could be added onto MSNP-Sharp, let the programmer configure and program the classes himself/herself for their client. I am not quite sure, however I am figuring out that I may be able to add these conversions internally.<p />

I will add more questions during my continued research.<br>
