# Known Issues #

  * **P2P framework doesn't work for Provisioned\_Accounts:** There is no more P2P support for provisioned accounts in MSNP21. That means; Broadcasting avatar, custom emoticons, file transfers and activity invitations won't work if you are using provisioned accounts for your bots. This is M$'s bug, not ours. If you want to use P2P framework for provisioned accounts, you must downgrade to MSNP18 (MSNPSharp v3.2.X).

## <font color='#00CC00'>Version 5.0.0.2717 (03 January 2012)</font> ##

### What's New ###

  * Implement HTTP polling transport, basically it encapsulates the MSNP commands into an HTTP request, and receive responses by polling a specific url (gateway.messenger.hotmail.com:80). Port 1863 is blocked by some ISP. If you want not to use http polling feature just set `Settings.DisableHttpPolling=true`, so tcp connection is used for name server connections.

### Upgrade Notes ###

  * 5.X is backward compatible with 4.X.
  * `NameserverProcessor` property removed from Messenger class and added `ConnectionEstablished` and `ConnectionClosed` events. Added `MessageProcessorChanged` event to nameserver to listen connected, disconnected events. It will remain null until connected, so you can use `NameserverProcessor` only when `MessageProcessorChanged` was fired.
